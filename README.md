Diagrams and designs for OnCall university housing resident advisor contact system
The “On-Call” messaging system is designed to allow for standardization of student and advisor contact in college dorms. The system features groups, where advisors and students can easily see who they are assigned to and allows advisors to toggle availability.
The system is a simple solution to the lack of an easy and standardized communication network for resident advisors and students
The system could be marketed and sold to universities across the world. There is also the possibility of collecting data for sale or analysis.
